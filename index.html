                        <p>Jubilee Austen is my Skillcrush course final project. I worked from a Photoshop design comp to code and style this single page website. The design tested my new tech skills, from extracting images and icons to finding measurements and colors. I created links, lists, and columns while floating elements and adding padding and margins. As I said, this page put everything I learned about HTML and CSS to the test; one I passed. For bonus points, I uploaded my files to laurenslayouts.com and utilized the command line with Git to put this page on GitHub.

                        <p>This exercise to design a multiple recipe card website was a fun one. It was essentially a simple exercise, three repeating cards differing only by images and text, but you felt accomplished after writing the CSS for it. Seeing the stylistic changes on the webpage as I conquered the floats, padding, borders, and lists was quite rewarding. </p>

                        <p>Single page website derived from a Photoshop design comp. Brought this page from comp to complete using the tools I've learned in Photoshop to assist me in coding it up. I don't know if it's due to the layout of the page, colors, typography, or simply that I love green beans, but this page draws me in. I felt accomplished when I was able to code it to match the design comp. Plus, having grown beans myself, how perfect is the name Rogue Pickings.</p>

                        <p>My tech journey started after 15+ years cross-training in the working world. The portfolio I've curated focuses on the coding I've learned thus far, but is essentially cumulative of my professional maturity and skills. My focus is web development and design that is clean and functional. To keep my self balanced, I practice yoga almost daily, read a book about as much, and workout. I enjoy streaming documentaries and recently vacationed in Schitt's Creek. A fact that typically surprises people is that I have a second degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do. The strengths I have established through my work and hobbies have taught me that it's all about the details, to focus, have perseverance, to manage myself and time effectively, and to "be here, now." Currently, I can code in HTML &amp; CSS. I've worked in the command line with Git and version control with GitHub. I enjoy continuously learning Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to further my graphic design knowledge. I'm Lauren Pelczynski, and thank you for visiting.</p>
